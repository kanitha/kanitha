- 👋 Hi, I’m @kanitha
- 👀 I’m interested in creating & testing products/services that brings value to people's lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to put the pieces together -the lessons and the knowledge gained from my experiences to bridge the gaps and become a better contributor/leader.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on discussing leadership ideas, to build the idea into a product. I am also interested in delivering talks about how students transitioning from college grads to techies can prepare themselves better for this competitive world.
