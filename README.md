- 👋 Hi, I’m @kanitha
- 👀 I’m interested in creating & testing products/services that brings value to people's lives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to put the pieces together -the lessons and the knowledge gained from my experiences to bridge the gaps and become a better contributor/team mate/leader.
- 💞️ I love analysing processes and the impact a product creates on its users. I love working or participating in a dynamic environment which makes everyone hungry for challenges that can make a difference.
